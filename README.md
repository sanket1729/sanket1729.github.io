Special thanks to Booyaa for licensing this website. I deployed this page in 
under 30 minutes. Thanks for the hard work.

## Cobalt source files for sanket1729.github.io

When you don't know anything about webpages, but want to create a cool one.
I don't have the time to debug why travis is not working. I manually build 
the page locally and deploy it on master as follows

```
# on source branch
cobalt build
cobalt import --branch master
# now push master for deployment code, source for source code backup
```
